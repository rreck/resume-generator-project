GENERATIVE AI
Understand What Artificial Intelligence Can Do For Your Business

Solution Based
Our strategy is to provide a
solution instead of forcing a
product. Typical customers do
not intend to be experts at AI,
they merely want to use AI to
stay competitive and further
their business needs.

Cost Containment
Anyone using the typical cloud
behemoths know that when
you need to know the cost up
front you wont be using it. We
do not promote confusion. We
do not require you to become
experts in complicated pricing
models and hidden costs. AI
costs money, but we do not
use a sneak up and surprise
approach.

Protection
Generative AI is the bridge
between users and
widespread adoption The
challenge is that there are
currently huge holes in how it
is delivered and we will
mitigate your risks.

The Next Stage in Evolution
Some technological advancements create pivot points in time
that reward those who can adapt.In the past large impact
advancements like the wheel, gunpowder and the combustion
engine all created situations where incredible advancement
occurred. Today, arti cial intelligence creates a rapidly changing
landscape that will bring about fantastic change. RRECKTEK
will support you through that change and make it work for you.

Why RRECKTEK?
RRECKTEK combines personal attention and technology
leadership to adjust to “what you need” not just “what we sell”.

Use Public or Private Resource?

LLM Improvement?
There several ways to alter how
generative AI responds to a
prompt You are invited to learn as
much or as little as you want.
• Model Selection - we support

literally thousands of models.
• Prompt Engineering - Prompts

are more art than science.
• Hyperparameters -Make the

right settings from the start.

RRECKTEK’s o ering addresses the major challenges business
face in adopting generative AI. The single biggest gap in public
generative AI is what we call data sovereignty. At its heart data
sovereignty is about staying in control of what happens to your
companies’ data. Many companies face a challenge because
putting customer or internal data in engines like ChatGPT is
irresponsible and really not an option. When you use
RRECKTEK, your data is on entirely private equipment that no
one has access to beside those you delegate.

Another challenge companies face is model drift. Nothing
prevents large companies from modifying their o ering
unpredictably behind the scenes. What worked yesterday may
not work today. With RRECKTEK nothing changes unless it is
intended to, We have many thousand models at our disposal and
make any changes in a predictable and controlled fashion.
Without measurements, it is impossible to know if you are
getting closer or farther from your goal.

• RAG - This technique provides

the context and relevant
information in the prompt.
• Fine tuning -This is a delicate

yet useful strategy that can
improve inference.
• LORA _ This form of tuning

focuses foundation models on
a speci c domain.
• Embedding- We adore

semantic vectors and have
been working with them for a
long time.
